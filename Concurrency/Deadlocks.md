# Deadlocks
## What is a deadlock?
 - A deadlock occurs when all processes are blocked while waiting for each
other and the program cannot proceed further.

Let’s have a look at the conditions for a deadlock to occur:

## Coffman Conditions 

There are four conditions, known as the Coffman Conditions, that must be
present simultaneously for a deadlock to occur:

### Mutual Exclusion 
A concurrent process holds at least one resource at any one time making it non-sharable.

### Hold And Wait 
A concurrent process holds a resource and is waiting for an additional
resource.

### No Preemption 
A resource held by a concurrent process cannot be taken away by the system.
It can only be freed by the process holding it

### Circular Wait 
A concurrent process must be waiting on a chain of other concurrent processes such that P1 is waiting 
on P2, P2 on P3, and so on, and there exists a Pn which is waiting on P1. This forms a circular loop.

In order to prevent deadlocks, we need to make sure that at least one of the conditions stated above should not hold. The good news is that Go is able to detect deadlocks at runtime.
Here is an example of how Go detects deadlocks:

```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
        mychannel := make(chan int)
}
mychannel <- 10
fmt.Println(<-mychannel)

```

If you run the code above, you will get the following error:

```
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!
goroutine 1 [chan send]:
main.main()
    /usercode/main.go:6 +0x62
exit status 2

```
This is because the program is stuck on sending a value to the channel: mychannel <- 10 . The sending operation is a blocking operation and requires
the receive channel to be ready before sending data to the channel.
Note that we can avoid this deadlock if we put the send operation in a goroutine such that both the send/receive operations are ready for each other simultaneously.


```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
        mychannel := make(chan int)
      go func(){
        mychannel <- 10
}()
fmt.Println(<-mychannel)
}

```
Bear in mind that Go only detects deadlocks when the program is stuck as a whole and not when a few of the goroutines are blocked. 
Also, goroutines are mostly blocked while waiting for a channel operation or for the locks which belong to the sync package. Have a look 
at an example below:

```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
        mychannel1 := make(chan int)
        mychannel2 := make(chan int)
        mychannel3 := make(chan int)
        go func(){
                <-mychannel1
        }()
        go func(){
                mychannel2 <- 20
}()
        go func(){
                <-mychannel3
        }()
        fmt.Println(<-mychannel2)
}

```

As you can see from the code above, the first and the third goroutine are blocked because there is no send operation that sends to these channels.
Still, the program executes successfully and we don’t get any deadlock error as it only occurs when the program is stuck as a whole
