# Range and Close

you are already familiar with this pattern.

- In Go, we have a range function which lets us iterate over elements in different data structures. Using this function, we can range over the 
items we receive on a channel until it is closed. Also, note that only the sender, not the receiver, should close the channel when it feels that 
it has no more values to send.

```
package main
import "fmt"
type Money struct{
  amount int
  year int
}
func sendMoney(parent chan Money){
  for i:=0; i<=18; i++ {
    parent <- Money{5000,i}
}
  close(parent)
}
func main() {
  money := make(chan Money)
  go sendMoney(money)
  for kidMoney:= range money {
    fmt.Printf("Money received by kid in year %d : %d\n", kidMoney.year, kidMoney.amount)
} }



```
- The above code is an over-simplification of the money transfer that happens between parents and their kids. 
So your parents keep sending you money until you hit the age of 18 and thatâ€™s when they close the channel.

- The for-loop kidMoney:= range money receives data from the money channel until the parent channel closes itself in the sendMoney function on line 14.
close(parent) sends a signal to the range loop to terminate.

Note: If you are sending on a closed channel, it will cause a panic.
